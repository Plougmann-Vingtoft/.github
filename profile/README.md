## Plougmann Vingtoft

We work with intellectual property (IP) to help organizations & individuals protect, manage, and commercialize innovation.

Our focus spans:
Patents – strategy, drafting, prosecution, and portfolio management
Trademarks & designs – protection, enforcement, and lifecycle management
IP strategy – aligning intellectual property with business and product strategy
Commercialization – turning IP into measurable business value

This GitHub organization contains internal tools, templates and shared assets that support our work with IP, technology, and innovation.
